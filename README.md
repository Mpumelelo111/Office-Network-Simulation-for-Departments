# Office-Network-Simulation-for-Departments
Office-Network-Simulation-with-Cisco-Packet-Tracer

## Description
This project is a network topology simulation for an office environment with multiple departments, designed using Cisco Packet Tracer. The topology demonstrates how different LANs (Local Area Networks) can be interconnected via routers and switches, ensuring efficient communication and management of network resources.

### Features
# Four Departments:
LAN1: Engineers 1 (192.168.6.0/24)
LAN2: Engineers 2 (192.168.7.0/24)
LAN3: Clerical Staff (192.168.8.0/24)
LAN4: Management (192.168.9.0/24)
# Devices include:
PCs, IP Phones, Servers, and Access Points.
Routers and Switches to interconnect LANs.
# Proper subnetting with unique IP ranges for each department.
Testing and validation of ICMP (ping) connectivity between devices across LANs.
Includes wireless connectivity via an Access Point for Clerical Staff.

#### Purpose
To simulate a real-world office network environment.
To demonstrate efficient network design and interconnectivity across departments.
To showcase how Cisco Packet Tracer can be used for educational and professional purposes in network design.

##### How to Use
Open the .pkt file using Cisco Packet Tracer.
Explore the network topology to understand the connections and configurations.
Test connectivity by using the ping command from devices in one LAN to devices in another LAN.
Modify the topology or configurations as needed to suit your use case.

###### Network Details
# IP Addressing Scheme:
LAN1: 192.168.6.0/24
LAN2: 192.168.7.0/24
LAN3: 192.168.8.0/24
LAN4: 192.168.9.0/24
# Routers:
Router2 and Router3 are used to interconnect the LANs.
# Switches:
Each LAN has its dedicated switch for managing local devices.
# Additional Notes:
Server in LAN1 for centralized services.
Access Point in LAN3 for wireless devices.

######## Skills Demonstrated
Subnetting and IP addressing.
Router and switch configuration.
Network testing and troubleshooting using Cisco Packet Tracer.

######## Future Improvements
Implement security features like VLANs and ACLs.
Simulate real-world traffic patterns.
Add more devices or departments to expand the topology.

######### Prerequisites
Cisco Packet Tracer software installed.
Basic understanding of networking concepts like IP addressing, subnetting, and routing.
